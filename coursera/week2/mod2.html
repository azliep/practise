                    So, even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say, in another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you. You think because l'm kind that it means I'm naive, and maybe I am. It's strategic and necessary. This is how I fight. The only thing I do know is that we have to be kind. Please, be kind. Especially when we don't know what's going on. Every rejection, every disappointment has led you to this moment. Don't let anything distract you from it.

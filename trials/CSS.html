        <pre class="class">It is a long established fact that a reader 
            will be distracted by the readable content of a 
            page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
            Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 
            'Content here, content here', making it look like 
            readable English.

            We're no strangers to love
            You know the rules and so do I
            A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
            You wouldn't get this from any other guy

            I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
            Gotta make you understand

            Never gonna give you up
            Never gonna let you down
            Never gonna run around and desert you
            Never gonna make you cry
            Never gonna say goodbye
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

            We've known each other for so long
            Your heart's been aching, but
            You're too shy to say it
            Inside, we both know what's been going on
            We know the game and we're gonna play it

            And if you ask me how I'm feeling
            Don't tell me you're too blind to see

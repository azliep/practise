this is a poem about how <mark>i love ngawang tobden</mark>
although i dont or rarely show it back then
for me, he's the best
he's sweet, charming, and just the kindest
amongst all the people i've ever met

<span style="border: 1px solid black">he's always there</span> to be with me
<div style="border: 1px solid black">and made me feel less alone</div>
through him that im more open and can see
what i couldnt through even just our phones
and i wish he could see what he really means to me

<ins>my star</ins>

hes like the stars i always reach out
and wished for my greatest desires
the star who never made me doubt
and the star who's such a bad liar

he keeps telling me that he's okay even though I know he's not
but i guess i participated in that as well
got caught up in my own world that's only like a dot
amidst the billion there is that i've hidden from, as they all ring a bell

amidst the billion there is that has their own to tell
they say the sun is a star too

he is the sun in the night
that i cry myself to sleep
not as bright, and just enough light
to keep me from the deep

i just wish he'd stop running away
and know that i will stay
to gravitate him towards me
i dont care how much it spins, as long as im with him,

that is until the fire doesnt consume him within
we all are uncertain
have our insecurities 

And doubts when it rains
he taught me unconditional love, that i once found cheezy n stupid
but then our worlds have flipped, and i saw what he did
it changed my perspective, and as so we did
but our feelings remained, and i hope he too would stay

<sub>to stop</sub> <b>running away and</b> <sup>come out with me to play</sup>
